## File Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file with app structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Complete CSS styling with responsive design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Main JavaScript application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json       # PWA manifest for installation

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Files
Create a new folder and save all the provided files:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css` 
- `script.js`
- `manifest.json`
- `sw.js`

### 2. Local Development
For local testing, you need to serve the files via HTTP (not file://) due to service worker requirements:

**Option A: Using Python**
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

**Option B: Using Node.js**
```bash
npx http-server .
```

**Option C: Using PHP**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### 3. Deploy to Production

## Adding Exercise Images

The app uses images to demonstrate exercises. To add your exercise images:

2. Use the following naming convention for your images:
   - hamstring-stretch.jpg
   - piriformis-stretch.jpg
   - standing-hip-flexor.jpg
   - straight-leg-raise.jpg
   - bridge.jpg
   - clamshells.jpg
   - cervical-retraction.jpg
   - thoracic-extension.jpg
   - lumbar-extension.jpg

Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG or JPEG
- Recommended size: 1280x720 pixels
- File size: Optimize for web (recommended under 200KB per image)
- Content: Clear, well-lit photos showing the exercise in progress
- Style: Consistent background and lighting across all images
- For each exercise, provide two images:
  1. Starting position
  2. End position or movement in progress

The images will be automatically cached by the service worker for offline use.
